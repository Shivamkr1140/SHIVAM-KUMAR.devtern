Datascience Internship - Internship Tasks

Data Science Task -01

Detecting Fake News
Detecting fake news is a critical challenge in today’s information age. In this project, we will use Python to build a machine learning model to differentiate between real and fake news. We will apply a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, a popular algorithm for text classification. By the end of this project, you will have a better understanding of data exploration, model building, and performance evaluation in text classification

Task Overview
Objective: Differentiate between real and fake news using a Python project applying a PassiveAggressiveClassifier. 

Data Science Task -02

Uber Trips Analysis in Python
Analyzing Uber trips can provide valuable insights into ride patterns, helping optimize services and improve customer experiences. In this project, we will analyze Uber ride data to detect patterns and relationships between different variables using Python. We’ll perform data exploration, uncover hidden patterns, and visualize the relationships discovered in the data.

Task Overview
Objective: Analyze Uber rides to detect patterns and relationships between different variables using Python.

Data Science Task -03

The Discovery of Handwashing – A Python Recreation
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis’s discovery of the importance of handwashing in hospitals revolutionized healthcare and significantly reduced mortality rates. In this project, we will recreate Dr. Semmelweis’s discovery using Python. We will read the historical dataset, explore the relationship between variables over different periods, perform calculations to compare mortality rates before and after handwashing implementation, and visualize the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates.

Task Overview
Objective: Recreate Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis’s discovery of the importance of handwashing in hospitals using Python.
